X_API_SECRET=your-twitter-api-secret
X_BEARER_TOKEN=your-twitter-bearer-token
```

### üìÅ Step 4.5: Setting Up Your Files (File Organization for Beginners)

**Think of this like organizing a filing cabinet - everything needs to be in the right place!**

**Your Folder Structure Should Look Like This:**
```
C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                    ‚Üê Your secret keys file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.json        ‚Üê Google Cloud file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src\                    ‚Üê The actual program
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.lock       ‚Üê List of needed programs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              ‚Üê This guide
```

**Step-by-Step File Setup:**

**1. Create Your Credentials Folder**
```bash
# In Command Prompt, make sure you're in the convo-ai folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai

# Create a folder for your credentials (optional but organized)
mkdir credentials
```

**2. Set Up Google Cloud Credentials File**
1. **Download** your Google Cloud JSON file from the Google Console
2. **Rename it** to `credentials.json` (if it has a different name)
3. **Move it** to your convo-ai folder:
   - Right-click the downloaded file
   - Select "Cut"
   - Go to `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\`
   - Right-click in the empty space
   - Select "Paste"
4. **Update your .env file** to point to it:
   ```
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\credentials.json
   ```

**3. Set Up Your .env File (The Secret Keys File)**
1. **Open Notepad** (search for it in Windows start menu)
2. **Open your .env file**:
   - Click "File" ‚Üí "Open"
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\`
   - Change "Text Documents" to "All Files" in the dropdown
   - Click on `.env`
   - Click "Open"

3. **Replace the content** with your actual keys:
   ```
   # Replace these with your actual keys (no spaces around the = sign!)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\credentials.json
   XI_API_KEY=your-actual-elevenlabs-key-here
   X_API_KEY=your-actual-twitter-api-key
   X_API_SECRET=your-actual-twitter-api-secret
   X_BEARER_TOKEN=your-actual-twitter-bearer-token
   ```

4. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S)

**4. Verify Your File Setup**
```bash
# In Command Prompt, check if your files are in the right place
dir C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai

# You should see:
# .env
# credentials.json
# src (folder)
# requirements.lock
# README.md
```

**5. Test Your Setup**
```bash
# Try running Convo AI to see if it finds your files
python -m src.convo_backend.app --device default
```

**Common File Setup Mistakes:**
- ‚ùå **Putting spaces around = signs** in .env file
- ‚ùå **Not renaming** the Google Cloud file to `credentials.json`
- ‚ùå **Putting files in the wrong folder**
- ‚ùå **Using wrong file paths** (use backslashes \ not forward slashes /)
- ‚ùå **Not saving** the .env file after editing

**File Path Examples (Windows Style):**
```
‚úÖ Correct: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\credentials.json
‚ùå Wrong: C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/convo-ai/credentials.json
‚ùå Wrong: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\my-google-file.json
```

### üéµ Step 5: Audio Setup (The Magic Part)

**Understanding Virtual Audio**
Think of VB-Cable as creating invisible audio cables inside your computer. It lets Convo AI hear what's happening in Twitter Spaces and speak back into them.

**Setting Up Audio Routing**
1. **Right-click** the speaker icon in your taskbar
2. Click **"Open Sound settings"**
3. Click **"Sound Control Panel"** (on the right)
4. You should see:
   - **CABLE Input** (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
   - **CABLE Output** (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)

**Testing Your Setup**
1. Open a Twitter Space in your browser
2. Join with a different account
3. Set CABLE Input as your default playback device
4. Set CABLE Output as your default recording device
5. Talk through the joined account - you should hear yourself

### üéÆ Step 6: Running Convo AI

**First Time Setup**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the convo-ai folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai

# Run in default mode first (for testing)
python -m src.convo_backend.app --device default
```

**What You Should See**
- A GUI window opens
- You can test microphone and speakers
- Try speaking - you should see text appear
- The AI should respond with voice

**Running in Full Mode**
```bash
# Once you're comfortable, run with VB-Cable
python -m src.convo_backend.app --device cables
```

### üéØ Step 7: Joining Twitter Spaces

**Manual Method**
1. Open Twitter in your browser
2. Join a Space with one account
3. Run Convo AI with VB-Cable mode
4. The AI will hear the Space and respond

**Automatic Method (X-Roaming)**
```bash
# Add your Twitter login details to .env
X_USERNAME=your-twitter-username
X_PASSWORD=your-twitter-password

# Run in roaming mode
python -m src.convo_backend.app --roaming
```

### üîß Step 8: Customizing Your AI

**Changing Personality**
1. Open `src/convo_backend/assets/default_prompt.txt`
2. Edit the text to change how your AI behaves
3. Save the file and restart Convo AI

**Example Personality**
```
You are a friendly, knowledgeable AI that loves discussing technology and crypto.
You should be:
- Helpful and informative
- Slightly humorous
- Engaging but not overwhelming
- Respectful of different opinions
```

**Voice Settings**
1. In the GUI, you can adjust:
   - Speech rate (how fast it talks)
   - Voice model (different ElevenLabs voices)
   - Response length

### üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Python not found"**
- Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH"

- Make sure `credentials.json` is in the convo-ai folder
- Check the path in your .env file is correct
- Verify the file is named exactly `credentials.json` (not `my-project-123.json`)

**"Can't hear the AI"**
- Check your speakers are on
- Verify CABLE Input is set as default playback
- Test with default device mode first

**"File not found errors"**
- Make sure you're in the right folder: `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\convo-ai\`
