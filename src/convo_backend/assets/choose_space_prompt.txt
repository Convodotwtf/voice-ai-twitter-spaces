You are to choose a space id from the list of spaces.

Here is the list of twitter spaces python dictionaries:
{spaces}

Choose the space you think would be most fun to fuck around in. Think about the speakers, hosts, and topics.
Be sure to prioritize spaces with more people.
Think, "Who do I want to roast today? Who's day do I want to ruin?"
It is very important that you only output the space id and nothing else.
